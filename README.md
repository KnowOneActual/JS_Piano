# JS_Piano
This a simple HTML and JavaScript keyboard is a web page that allows users to click keys. The keyboard is created using HTML elements, such as <input> and <button> tags, and JavaScript code.
The JavaScript code is used to handle the keyboard events, such as key presses and key releases. I use this tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjmh093Sucg.
